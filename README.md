# VNN: Variable Dense Neural Network

## Tests for VNN

* **Image Classification**: Image Classification Dataset w/ upscale and downscale:
    * Using the MNIST dataset

* **Normal:** Autoencoding 

* **Reinforcement Learning, Hardest Part:** Reinforcement Automatic Robot Design and Control (evogym, please try to find out how to install)
    * Write PPO code. **consider using baselines PPO code, or some other implementation**)

* **Sentimental Analysis:** Sentimental Analysis 
    * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
    * CONSIDER USING GLUE TEXT CLASSIFICATION!
    * Still deciding.


## Suggestion

* Combination between LSTM and transformer, some way to preserve the internal state...
    * How to do this???
